# Bachelor's thesis project
This thesis focuses on developing a web application to display catalog data using Flask, a
Python web framework. The website aims to provide users with a reliable platform that is easy
to access and view mobile specifications. The Flask framework is used to set up the server-side
infrastructure and handle routing, while a PostgreSQL database is integrated to efficiently
store and retrieve phone specifications. The site communicates with the mobile specification
API to retrieve and store the latest mobile data, ensuring that the database remains up-to-date.
The front end of the app is designed using HTML and CSS for an enhanced look. The website
offers a comprehensive search function and allows users to view detailed specifications. This
work contributes to meeting the demand for an easily accessible and comprehensive mobile
